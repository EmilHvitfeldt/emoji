The goal of emoji is to provide up to date information inn the form of data sets on emojis and their use.

``` r

devtools::install_github("EmilHvitfeldt/emoji")
```

## Example

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tibble)
```

The main data set in this package is the `emojis` data set which contains almost all the information contained in this package.

```{r}
library(emoji)

emojis
```

the `emoji_name` is a vector of emojis with descriptive names 

```{r}
emoji_name[1:10]
```

Each of the emojis have zero or more keywords associated with them.

```{r}
emoji_keyword[c(150:155)]
